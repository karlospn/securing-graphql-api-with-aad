# Securing a graphQL API with Azure Active Directory

This repository contains a practical example (``/src/GraphQL.WebApi``) about how you can secure a graphQL api with Azure Active Directory using the Microsoft.Identity.Web nuget package. The api also contains an example about how you can protect the introspect query using a custom interceptor.    
The graphQL api is built using HotChocolate.    

This repository contains another example (``/src/GraphQL.Client``) that shows you how to call a secured graphQL API using the graphQL.Client and the Microsoft.Identity.Client nuget packages.
